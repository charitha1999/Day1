//JAVASCRIPT DATATYPES
JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects 
var length = 16;                               // Number
var lastName = "Johnson";                      // String
var x = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};    // Object


//JavaScript Types are Dynamic
JavaScript has dynamic types. 
This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:

var x;           // Now x is undefined
x = 5;           // Now x is a Number
x = "John";      // Now x is a String


//JavaScript Strings
A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".
Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:

var carName1 = "Volvo XC60";   // Using double quotes
var carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';   // Using single quotes


//JavaScript Numbers
JavaScript has only one type of numbers.
Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:

var x1 = 34.00;     // Written with decimals
var x2 = 34;        // Written without decimals





//JavaScript Booleans
Booleans can only have two values: true or falsee

var x = 5;
var y = 5;
var z = 6;
(x == y)       // Returns true
(x == z)       // Returns false
